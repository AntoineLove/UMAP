# UMAP

Data analysis of Hindi alphabet and Aerial Spectrometry data (SHABD and AVIRIS datasets) using UMAP and compared with PCA. 

## Sources
The datasets are too large to compress and put onto GitHub and will need to be retrieved manually from their sources.
- The SHABD Dataset can be found on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/sushantshetty/shabd-complete-hindi-characters-dataset
- The AVIRIS Dataset can be found here: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes#Salinas_scene
